With wit and great empathy, Chris Bachelder introduces us to Charles, a psychologist whose expertise is in high demand; George, a garrulous public librarian; Fat Michael, envied and despised by the others for being exquisitely fit; Jeff, a recently divorced man who has become a theorist of marriage; and many more. Over the course of a weekend, the men reveal their secret hopes, fears, and passions as they choose roles, spend a long night of the soul preparing for the play, and finally enact their bizarre ritual for what may be the last time. Along the way, mishaps, misunderstandings, and grievances pile up, and the comforting traditions holding the group together threaten to give way. The Throwback Special is a moving and comic tale filled with pitch-perfect observations about manhood, marriage, middle age, and the rituals we all enact as part of being alive.");

But beneath the hopeful veneer, there was another Brooklyn, a dangerous place where grown men reached for innocent girls in dark hallways, where ghosts haunted the night, where mothers disappeared. A world where madness was just a sunset away and fathers found hope in religion. Like Louise Meriwetheréˆ¥æªš Daddy Was a Number Runner and Dorothy Allisonéˆ¥æªš Bastard Out of Carolina, Jacqueline Woodsonéˆ¥æªš Another Brooklyn heartbreakingly illuminates the formative time when childhood gives way to adulthoodéˆ¥æ”–he promise and peril of growing upéˆ¥æ”�nd exquisitely renders a powerful, indelible, and fleeting friendship that united four young lives.");
